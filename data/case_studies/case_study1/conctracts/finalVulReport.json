This can lead to potential ownership vulnerability where an attacker could deploy the contract and set themselves as the 'ico' address, gaining control over the token minting process. The severity of this vulnerability is high as it compromises the integrity of the token issuance process. The correctness score is 7 because the vulnerability is correctly identified. The severity score is 8 due to the significant impact on the token issuance process. The profitability score is 6 as exploiting this vulnerability could potentially lead to financial gains for an attacker.",

If the total supply exceeds the TOKEN_LIMIT, it could result in unexpected behavior. The correctness score is 8 as the vulnerability is correctly identified.

This could potentially allow unauthorized parties to unfreeze token transfers. The correctness score is 7 as the vulnerability is correctly identified.
