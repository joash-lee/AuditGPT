## Welcome to Audit GPT!

AuditGPT is a smart contract auditor made on the streamlit platform. Its goal is to converse with the user at each stage, and audit a set of smart contracts for the user to check for any security vulnerabilities.

You may run the platform locally or access it at this link: https://auditgpt.streamlit.app/

This Project was done for a final year project for Nanyang Technological University, Singapore for the School of Computer Science
